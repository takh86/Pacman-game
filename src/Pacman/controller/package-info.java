/**
 * Package of the controller class for the Pacman game.
 * <p>
 * The controller orchestrates the game by handling user input, updating the model,
 * and refreshing the view accordingly. It acts as an intermediary between the model
 * (game logic) and the view (game presentation), ensuring that user actions are
 * reflected in the game state and visuals.
 * <p>
 * This package should contain interfaces that define the interactions between the
 * controller, the view, and the model. It allows for different implementations of
 * views to work seamlessly with the game logic encapsulated in the model.
